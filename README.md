An app that visualizes geo-temporal data from NY taxi pickups using H3 and time series.
It can be useful to visualize marketplace signals that are distributed spatially and temporally.

By leveraging intuitive filters in the sidebar, users can refine their analysis based on date,
time, or specific H3 cell, allowing for a granular exploration of demand patterns. Whether
seeking real-time or forecasted demand, the application generates dynamic charts that precisely
reflect the selected parameters across all H3 hexagons or a singular focus.

Additionally, the sidebar features a SMAPE metric table, providing an insightful comparison of
prediction accuracy across H3 cells. A lower SMAPE score indicates a more accurate prediction,
empowering users to identify the most reliable forecasts effortlessly.
